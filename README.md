## My process

  1. Before taking on the challenge, I established my foundational knowledge in Tailwind.
  2. I began coding the semantics for HTML, focusing on structuring the document.
  3. I implemented tailwind commenting some html so I can focus on designing one html at a time.
  4. The design process involved implementing familiar Tailwind classes and referring to the documentation for unfamiliar ones.
  5. When opportunities arose to reduce code, such as in default styles for the body and btn class, I took advantage of them.
  6. Later in the process, I discovered a style guide and incorporated its principles to ensure consistency and best practices in my design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- The proper usage of divs and main to seperate related elements and style them much more conviently using tailwind.

- The customization in tailwind.config.js for specific colors and font family.

- The centering of the main content using grid columns.

- The benefits of using mobile first approach.

- The process of working with a given template and a set of standards to follow.

- Making an image round using a container.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue using the tailwind framework as there's much I've yet to try.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxmDnn7lrnk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gpXORlEHjc5bgnIi5HEGhw) - This playlist allowed me to build my fundamentals in Tailwind.

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me refer to unfamiliar concepts and resources I may be able to use.
